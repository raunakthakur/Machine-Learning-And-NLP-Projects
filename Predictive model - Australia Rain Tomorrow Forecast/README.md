### Context
Predict next-day rain by training classification models on the target variable RainTomorrow.It is a Imbalanced Classification dataset of Australia Rain Tomorrow Forecast Prediction .
The predictability of Weather phenomenon till date is still not mastered by Technology due to innate complexity of weather phenomenon which are still under study. 
The model is built by applying of Random Forest algorithm ensemble technique to forecast weather it will rain tomorrow on specific location based on geographic location and weather data .

### Content
This dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia.

RainTomorrow is the target variable to predict. It means -- did it rain the next day, Yes or No? This column is Yes if the rain for that day was 1mm or more.
